identifying the core’ of a social innovation 

Scalable social innovations tend to be ones that: 
• Are relevant beyond their initial context. 
• Are relatively simple. 
• Are clearly better than the alternatives. 
• Don’t rely solely on the talents of specific individuals



WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SCALE UP?

• How will you frame your social innovation for scaling? 
• What’s fundamental to making the delivery model work? 
• What evidence do you have that the innovation works? What’s key to achieving social impact? 
• Who’ll pay for your social innovation? Who’ll deliver it? Who’ll use it? Who’ll benefit from it? 
• How does your innovation fit with what exists already? Does it support or challenge existing systems and structures? 
• Do you have a viable business model, with a clear overview of cost structures and revenues? 
• Are your systems and processes capable of operating at higher volume, or capable of expanding?


Scaling Goals
One of the things that can help in setting goals is to determine the ‘addressable market’. This
means thinking about the number of people who could benefit from your innovation and working
out what is realistically possible to achieve.
Keep in Mind for scaling
Cash flow
Demand enhancement
Increasing the ability to keep your promises by investing in a pipeline of talent
And most of all, reminding yourself why you're doing this in the first place.

What is the social goal you are trying to achieve? 
• Is your practice sufficient to meet that goal? 
• What’s the size of the opportunity? What would scale actually look like? 
• What are your personal and organisational values? 
• What are your personal aspirations as a founder/leader? 
• What are your financial expectations?
